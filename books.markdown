Here's a list of books that have been instrumental in my growth and development as a trader.  Some of them are more tangential to the world of financial markets and investing, but they still helped me gain a unique perspective on trading and investing in general.  

#### Recommended Reading List:
- The Disciplined Trader
- Reminiscinces of a Stock Operator
- Market Wizards
- Technical Analysis from A to Z
- Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques
- Hagakure
- Zen in the Art of Archery
- The Art of War
