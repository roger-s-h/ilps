After coming out of college with a BS degree in *Applied Mathematics with a Specialization in Computing*, I started working as a software engineer for a webshop. This was just before the dotcom craze that started at the turn of the century.  

Eventually, my employer merged with another company in preparation to go public. It was at this time that I started to become interested in financial markets, investing, and trading.  

By the time we IPO'd, I had immersed myself in the world of financial markets. With the help of Incentive Stock Options I was granted as an employee (and the ["irrational exuberance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_exuberance) of that era), I was able to turn a little bit of money into a lot...  Not enough to retire on, but enough to give me the time and freedom to stop working and start thinking about what I *really* wanted to accomplish with my life.  

Unfortunately, the bubble burst before I could accumulate the level of success that I felt I needed for sustainable profitability and passive income. Fortunately, my cousin had been a Proprietary Trader for several years, and he helped me get my foot in the door at a brokerage that needed help on their Fixed Income trading desk (Bonds, Treasuries, Mortgage-Backed Securities, etc).  

This led to a career arc that spanned a little over 15 years at 5 different firms, but throughout my tenure I never tried building a book of clients nor wanted to manage other people's money.  

I was solely focused on gaining the experience and skills that would allow me to achieve my own financial goals through trading. All of the training I underwent and certifications I attained were all in an effort to gain a better understanding of the machinations of financial markets and the rules and regulations that govern them.  

But in the end, I learned that I didn't need to work "in the industry" to get what I wanted.  I didn't need my Series 7/24/55/blahblahblah licensess, other than how it enabled my roles with the firms that employed me.  

So where am I now?? I'm not yet retired, and I have a "day job" that doesn't involve trading.  I'm still working for someone who signs my paychecks, but I'm (overall) happy with my financial trajectory.
