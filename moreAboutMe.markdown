After coming out of college with a BS degree in *Applied Mathematics with a Specialization in Computing*, I started working as a software engineer for a webshop.  
This was just before the dotcom craze that started at the turn of the century.  

Eventually, my employer merged with another company in preparation to go public.  
It was at this time that I started to become interested in financial markets, investing, and trading.  

By the time we IPO'd, I had immersed myself in the world of financial markets.  
With the help of Incentive Stock Options I was granted as an employee, I was able to turn a little bit of money into a lot...  Not enough to retire on, but enough to give me the time and freedom to stop working and start thinking about what I *really* wanted to accomplish with my life.  

Unfortunately, the bubble burst before I could accumulate the level of success that I felt I needed for sustainable passivity.  
Fortunately, my cousin had been a Proprietary Trader for several years, and he helped me get my foot in the door at a brokerage that needed help on their Taxable Fixed Income trading desk.
