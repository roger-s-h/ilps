[*The Disciplined Trader*, by Mark Douglas and Paula T. Webb, PhD](https://www.amazon.com/Disciplined-TraderTM-Developing-Winning-Attitudes-ebook/)

There are many reasons why this one tops my list.

This wasn't the first book I had read relating to trading and investing.  But it *was* the first and only one that forced me to define, distill, and ultimately refine my own trading goals and my strategies to achieve them.

This book forced me to deconstruct everything I had learned about investing/trading and identify what I was trying to do and why I was trying to do it.  It helped me depersonalize my efforts and the results born from them.

Doing so allowed me to build a much more stable foundation for my goals and strategy, and helped me detach myself from the wide range of emotions that I experienced while making decisions and forming the conclusions that enabled them.

I have read it multiple times and it has never lost any relevance.  It explores human behavior, motivation, and emotion, and the roles they all play in one's decisionmaking.

A great read for anyone who isn't caught up in their own ego and is willing to grow from the inside out!!!
