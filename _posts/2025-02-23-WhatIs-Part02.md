## The Problem(s) with Penny Stocks.

What's the problem? Well, the problem is that there are **MANY** problems with Penny Stocks!

We can start by looking at the most egregious of ways people got ripped off.  I suppose we could look at the sentencing rules to determine which of these ways is the "worst", but that's outside the scope of this discussion.  We gotta start somewhere, so let's start with...

### FRAUD
Fraud manifests in many ways, but can generally be defined as the result of "fraudulent activity"... activity performed *with an intent to deceive* an investor **regardless of whether it results in a profit for the fraudster or results in a loss for the investor**.  On a corporate level, this can happen when a company issues shares that it knows has no value, and are later sold to investors who have been *intentionally* deceived into thinking that those shares have greater than their actual value.  And/or when such a company *intentionally* lies about how much money they're making or how much money they have.

Generally, INTENT plays a major role, where the fraudster has no intentions to adhere to the truth, but has intentions to profit from being untruthful or in some cases simply intends to cause financial harm to others.

Fraud can also occur at the Broker-Dealer/Advisor level, though outright fraud tends to be a little less common.  One way it *can* occur is not so much from a broker facilitating a transaction for you, but more so from a Registered Investment Advisor who fradulently advises you on your holdings and/or fraudulently informs you of the transactions in your account ([see Bernie Madoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Madoff)).
