[*Technical Analysis from A to Z*, by Stephen Achelis](https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Analysis-2nd-Steven-Achelis/dp/0071363483/)

This book served as a great reference while I was navigating the muck of the internet.  

It gave me a solid reference for quick and understnadable explanations for what would have otherwise been an overwhelming amount of incredible information during the dotcom boom.  

This book won't give a mathematical breakdown of how each and every technical indicator is calculated, but it gave me a lively springboard from which I could prepare myself for the splash as I dove into the cesspool of financial markets.  

And if my staying afloat is testimony, then this book is worth reading.
