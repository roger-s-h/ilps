### What Was Your Best Trade?

Percentage-wise, my two best trades were actually NOT involving Penny Stocks, and oddly enough, they both paid about 19-to-1 (+1900%)...  

Back around October/November 2016, I purchased the Fortress Investment Group (FIG) $6 Calls for April 2017 expiration.  These contracts were purchased while the stock was trading in the high $3 to low $4 range.  In February 2017, the company received a buyout offer from SoftBank and the stock price shot up above $8.  The contracts I purchased at an average price of $0.13 were trading around $2.50, where I exited the position for a nice %1900 profit!  

More recently, in March 2024 I purchased the Kinder Morgan (KMI) $20 Calls for January 2025 when the stock was trading in the low $18s.  In May I purchased the $22 Calls for the same expiration, and the $25 Calls for January 2026.  Towards the end of 2024, I ended up selling the $20s and $22s for Jan 2025 for a net profit of %1965!  Nice!  

As of today, I'm still holding the $25 Calls for Jan 2026.  We'll see how that ends up, but currently I'm up %1330 (avg purchase price of $0.24, current price of $3.43).  These contracts were priced at $7.35 when the stock was trading at $31 in January, around %3000 of my entry price!!  If I would've closed my position at that point, it would've been my best trade ever!  Frustrating to have it retrace as much as it has, but I still have 10 months to expiration. (pray)
