## More Problem(s) with Penny Stocks. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  :(

### Pump & Dump and Rugpull Schemes
P&D and Rugpull schemes typically involve the actions of VERY LARGE stakeholders/shareholders, who drum up public interest and awareness prior to unloading their stake to the public.  This is a long-side/bullish scheme, where the scammer will accumulate shares at a relatively low price, and sell them while/after deceived investors drive the price up.  In this sense, you can also consider unwarranted "smear campaigns" as their bearish counterpart, where the scammer either short-sells the shares and/or buys Put options, and profits from the subject security's decline.

So while there are a crapton more risks that involve immoral actions of others, there are just as many risks that are inherent to Penny Stocks and trading them...
