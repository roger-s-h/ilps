### What do you think of “[SYMBOL]”?

It'll be a long while, if ever, before I start offering my opinion on specific candidates for trades.  IT SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT ANYTHING I SAY IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE, AND YOU ARE *NOT* OBLIGED TO PAY FOR MY OPINION, WHETHER IT RELATES TO ANY POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS OR NOT.

Usually, when people ask these kinds of questions, they're looking for affirmation for decisions/conclusions they've already made.  There's also the chance that people ask these kinds of questions to draw attention to or drum up interest in something they've already bought into (i.e. Rugpull/P&D)...

For now, the closest you will get to me answering this question is to [follow me on Twitter/X](https://x.com/pennystockluvr).  I post a "Weekly Watchlist", and follow up with end-of-week regular session closing prices that summarize what happened with each one.  [Please read my post about my weekly screens](/FAQs/hotpicks/) to find out more about how I end up with my Weekly Watchlist, and understand more clearly why it isn't called my "Buy List" nor "Trade List" nor "DO SOMETHING THAT I TELL YOU TO DO List".

Please understand that any companies that might be mentioned are *NOT* to be considered recommendations to trade them, bearish or bullish!!  Such posts are *NOT* a Call To Action.  They are nothing more than a small list of tickers that I am keeping my eyes on.  

If I am being compensated by any issuer of a publicly traded stock for "promoting" their shares **or for any other reason**, I will disclose as such, as required by law ([See SEC Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(b)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1884/pdf/COMPS-1884.pdf)).  

And regarding "current position" disclosures, you should ALWAYS be skeptical!!!  As of now, there isn't a requirement for anyone to disclose what they own, or when they bought it, or how much they spent (unlesss their postion is large enough to require them to do so)...  You will *ALWAYS* be better off having doubt and drawing *your own* conclusions.
