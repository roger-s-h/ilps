[*Reminiscinces of a Stock Operator*, by Edwin Lefevre](https://www.amazon.com/Reminiscences-Stock-Operator-Edwin-Lefevre/dp/B093B23DWF/)

Nothing I would promote as a template for one's own strategy or course of action, **BUT**...

This book has the feel of [*The Cincinnati Kid*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059037/). Not necessarily the same arc and trajectory, but I think this book needs to be lauded for it's ability to connect to people and their aspirations... and using that connection to jolt them into realizing that things aren't always puppy dogs and rainbows.

There exists a dark side in each of us that current mainstream "Business" media won't touch or explore, and this book dissolves traditional ethical boundaries to expose a window, if not a mirror, to the moral character of a stereotypical trader.  Ridiculous when we see it in others, and shameful when we see it in ourselves.

Caveat Emptor, Caveat Venditor.
